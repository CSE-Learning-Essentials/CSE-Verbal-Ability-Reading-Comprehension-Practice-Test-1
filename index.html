<p><strong>1.</strong></p>
<p><em>PASSAGE:</em> In recent years, the Philippine government has intensified its efforts to address traffic congestion in Metro Manila, which has been cited as one of the worst in the world. Various solutions have been proposed and implemented, such as road-widening projects, stricter enforcement of traffic rules, and the promotion of carpooling. A major proposal under study is the improvement and expansion of the country’s public transportation system, including the construction of new railway lines and the modernization of jeepneys. These initiatives aim to reduce the number of private vehicles on the roads, improve commuter experience, and decrease air pollution. However, these projects face challenges such as funding issues, displacement of affected communities, and resistance from some stakeholders. Balancing the need for development with social and environmental concerns remains a key issue in solving Metro Manila’s traffic woes.</p>

<p><em>PASSAGE:</em> Urbanization in the Philippines has accelerated in recent decades, with more people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities.

<h3>Answer Explanations:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>1 — Answer: C</strong>  
<em>“Tackling Metro Manila’s Traffic Problem Amid Social and Environmental Concerns”</em>  
Explanation: While all choices mention the traffic issue and possible solutions, **C best reflects the central theme of the passage**, which is not only solving traffic congestion but also acknowledging the need to balance development efforts with the social and environmental challenges involved. Other choices focus too narrowly on just solutions (A), government actions (B), or impacts (D), but C comprehensively captures both the actions and the need to weigh the wider concerns.
</li>

<li>
<strong>2 — Answer: C</strong>  
<em>“Reforming the Philippine Education System Amid Challenges”</em>  
Explanation: The passage emphasizes the reforms being implemented in the education sector, while also addressing the various challenges faced along the way. **C is the most accurate title as it reflects both the ongoing reforms and the obstacles faced.** Other options (like A or B) either emphasize only one aspect (challenges or reforms), while C strikes the right balance.
</li>

<li>
<strong>3 — Answer: B</strong>  
<em>“Balancing Growth and Sustainability in Philippine Energy Development”</em>  
Explanation: The passage highlights the promotion of renewable energy sources while balancing three competing needs: economic growth, environmental protection, and energy security. **B best conveys this balance, making it the most appropriate choice.** Other options are either too narrow (like C, which only mentions challenges) or do not clearly reflect the idea of balance and sustainability.
</li>

<li>
<strong>4 — Answer: B</strong>  
<em>“Balancing Progress and Quality of Life in Philippine Cities”</em>  
Explanation: The passage presents the benefits of urbanization (economic progress and modernization) while also pointing out the negative consequences (overcrowding, strain on services, etc.). **B captures the essence of the passage by addressing the need to balance progress with maintaining residents’ quality of life.** Other titles focus on either growth alone (A) or challenges alone (C), but B combines both perspectives.
</li>

<li>
<strong>5 — Answer: B</strong>  
<em>“Balancing Productivity and Sustainability in Philippine Farming”</em>  
Explanation: The passage discusses the vital role of agriculture in food security and livelihoods while also noting the need for sustainable practices to protect the environment and support farmers. **B accurately reflects this dual focus on improving productivity and maintaining sustainability.** Other options touch on parts of the idea but do not emphasize the balance as clearly.
