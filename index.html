                <h3>1. PASSAGE: In the Philippines, there is growing concern over the need for stricter regulations on social media platforms like YouTube, due to the rapid spread of misinformation and harmful content. The government has proposed measures to hold content creators and platforms accountable for the content shared, aiming to protect users from cyberbullying, hate speech, and fake news. These regulations would require social media platforms to take a more active role in monitoring and removing harmful content, while also ensuring transparency in how algorithms curate and promote videos. However, such laws also raise concerns about censorship and the potential violation of freedom of expression, as creators might feel restricted in their content. Balancing the need for safety and protection with the right to free speech presents a significant challenge for lawmakers in the Philippines as they navigate the evolving landscape of online content regulation.</h3>

                <h3>2. PASSAGE: The term "West Philippine Sea" was officially adopted by the Philippine government in 2009 to refer to the part of the South China Sea that lies within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The name change was part of an effort to assert the country's sovereignty over the waters and islands in the region, especially amid rising tensions with China over territorial claims. By naming the body of water specifically, the Philippines aimed to emphasize its legal rights to the area and distinguish it from broader regional disputes. The term is now widely used in official documents and discussions regarding the maritime territories of the Philippines.</h3>
